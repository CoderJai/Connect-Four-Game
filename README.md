# connect-four

A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)) is a two-player board game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

In this repo, I will be putting extra focus on for loops. If you want to learn how to use for loops effectively, please have a look at my code.
What inbuilt functions are we going to focus on?

    for loops

# Rules of Connect Four

    You will start as player One
    You will take your go as player One
    You will not be allowed to go in squares that are not at the bottom of the grid, or do not have a taken square under it
    Once your go is taken and you did not win, It will be player Two's go
    The gamer will continue until a winning combination of four is reached by player One or player Two, or until the grid is full and no winning combination was found.
